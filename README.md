  The main goal of StudentHostel101 application is to handle all problems that students deal with while living in the student hostels.
For example,there is a simple registration/authorization so every student has his own account to do stuff.The application offers several
options to handle the common problems that apppear in the student rooms,such as garbage utilization,bread buying,chatting and so on.
The code needs fixing at some places where several architecture patterns were tested so there are some rudiments left.
 Feel free to pull requests and improve my project!I'm ready to hear all possible suggestions and discuss,implement them if possible.
